# Pan-ResistomeFinder

**Pan-ResistomeFinder** is a tool for automated extraction of stress-response and resistance genes across one or more annotated microbial genomes. It supports spreadsheets exported from annotation platforms and identifies functional genes using a curated set of biological keywords.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Detects stress-related and resistance-associated genes using flexible keyword filtering
- ‚úÖ Supports `.tsv`, `.csv`, `.xls`, and `.xlsx` formats
- ‚úÖ Automatically merges multi-organism gene tables into a unified presence/absence matrix
- ‚úÖ Works on both single-genome and pan-genome datasets
- ‚úÖ Designed for use in Google Colab or local Python environments

## Input Requirements

To use Pan-ResistomeFinder, prepare the following:

- **File formats supported:**  
  `.tsv`, `.csv`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`
  Each files should be saved in single folder after the name of organism for better annotated compiled results.

- **Required columns (case-sensitive):**  
  `Category`, `Subcategory`, `Subsystem`, and `Role`

- **Input content:**  
  The tool expects spreadsheet-formatted genomic annotations. It has been tested primarily on output files exported from **RAST** (Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology).

- **Single-genome support:**  
  If only one file is provided, the tool performs resistome discovery on that dataset.

- **Multi-genome (pangenome) support:**  
  When multiple files are found in the input folder, the tool merges the data into a presence-absence matrix. 

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è While this tool currently supports RAST-annotated spreadsheets, collaboration is welcome to extend support to other annotation outputs.
